# The Freelancing Experience
During high school I was fortunate enough to stuble upon a little [website](http://99designs.com) that allowed me to grow and practice my skills as a creative. 99designs.com is where startups can go to post graphic design contests to find their next logo. Designers all around the world compete with each other to create the winning design. Because of the fact that I could submit work from anywhere and communicate asynchronously with the clients, I turned my hobby for graphic design into source of extra income (aka a side hustle). 

During the time that I freelanced, I picked up so many valuable skills from interacting with the clients and holding myself to a higher standard since I was competing with all different kinds of designers. In the world of visual design, **communication** is key to understanding the needs of the client. **Conceptual thinking** is needed to communicate ideas and concepts visually on a logo that will symbolize the company goals. **Analytical skills** help you view the perspective of the client and understand their target audience and competing brands. With qualifying rounds lasting 72 hours or most times less, **time management** is essential for producing impressive designs in a limited time frame. With the deadline in mind, you must **work quickly and efficiently** under pressure. Since I was doing creative work, I also understood **licensing agreements**. Delivering the files to the client meant understanding differences in **file formats**, such as vector (AI, EPS) and raster (PNG, JPG).  I also had to **manage each project** and keep track of which stage the project was on: concept sketch, digital design creation, client communication and approval, and delivery of files.

Here is a logo design for a coffee house and modern workspace offering speaking events and live entertainment.
The client wanted a unique and artsy logo that would stand out from most cafe logos, so no generic coffee bean logos were going this route. I opted for a play on the words “social light” by creating a male and female as the bulb of a lightbulb.

In ancient Hawaiian, “Kanaloa” is symbolized as a squid and also the name of a volcano. This engineering team based in Honolulu, Hawaii was looking for a logo to represent this. I presented them two concepts. The first concept is a squid created from the general K and E letterforms. The squid legs are circuits to indicate they do electrical engineering, and other hidden engineering and technology symbols such as the Ohm, Wifi, and ground symbols were integrated into the logo. The second concept was a volcano with the shape of an E in the lava, which is designed to look like circuits. The K was hidden in the sun rays behind the volcano.

I made a custom wordmark logo designed for Ewa Beach music producer Fourth Note. I wanted to give the logo a fresh vibe by fully hand-lettering the “Fourth”. https://soundcloud.com/fourth-note
