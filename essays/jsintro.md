##  Dear Java: thank u, next. 

Dangerous, dynamic, adaptable, non-conforming, and vague are adjectives you'd think would be used to describe a "bad boy" that your parents warned you about to never date. In this case, that "bad boy" is Javascript. Coming from a Java and C/C++ perspective, little did I know that Javascript is what I have been yearning for in the long, arduous nights that I wasted with Java defining types and structuring classes with predefined feilds. 

Goodbye Java, I've found a more understanding and less strict and controlling programming language. This new language doesn't expect much from me, especially when I don't have to define types anymore, but we still can make it work. Also, this new language accepts me for my small mistakes that I make, such as forgetting a semicolon. My ex would have thrown a fit with a Syntax Error. Ariana Grande expressed her feelings about her exes in her "thank u, next" video: 

```
one taught me love
one taught me patience
and one taught me pain
```

I can agree with Ms. Grande, 




Equality Operators
```
// math
x = y

// java
x == y

// javascript
x === y

```
