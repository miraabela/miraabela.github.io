##  Dear Java: thank u, next. 

Dangerous, dynamic, adaptable, non-conforming, and vague are adjectives you'd think would be used to describe a "bad boy" that your parents warned you about to never date. In this case, that "bad boy" is Javascript. Coming from a Java and C/C++ perspective, little did I know that Javascript is what I have been yearning for in the long, arduous nights that I wasted with Java defining types and structuring classes with predefined feilds.  As Ariana Grande sang in her "thank u, next" video: 

```
one taught me love
one taught me patience
and one taught me pain
```




Equality Operators
```
// math
x = y

// java
x == y

// javascript
x === y

```
