## Why I Had No Life in High School
A little background... Web design, UX, and UI are some big reasons why I wanted to get into computer science in the first place. I started out with an art background, then became interested in graphic design, then in highschool I found myself spending a little too much time looking through [dribbble](http://dribbble.com), [Behance](www.behance.net), and [awwwards](www.awwwards.com) appreciating the gorgeous website/UI/UX designs, interactions, and animations that people made. ((All the hours that I wasted looking at HTML/CSS of these web designs make up for why I can do the WODs so quickly now, it takes a lot of time and patience, which I've already exhausted back in high school. [instead of going out and having a life])) I was really intrigued by the creative ways they would layout text, images, and media on a website that created visual appeal. So, on paper I was used to drawing my ideas, however everything I was creating was just static and not interactive. They were simply images your eyes could look at. After discovering interactive and beautiful web designs and expereinces on the aforementioned websites, I realized that I wanted to bring my designs and art to life somehow, and create things you could interact with. This is the part where computer science can make your creativity take flight. A website or app that you can scroll through, click, and play with adds so much more dimention to just static designs.

## Coffee Shop Napkin Mockups
However, back in highschool, I didn't have a clue on where to start with on building website designs, even though I fiddled with some of the code that other people wrote. If the code was already premade for the structure of the site, I knew how to mess around with it, but I didn't know how to build one from scratch. This is why I find learning Semantic UI to be especially useful, because now I have a starting point, wheras before I would stick to the traditional method of drawing designs on paper... or as freelance web desginers would talk with clients at a coffee shop and create a mockup on a napkin.


## UI Framework vs. Alternatives
### Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator

### Sketch

### Webflow

## Benefits of Using a UI Framework

### Automatically Responsive
Without using a UI framework, creating a responsive website that adjusts according to the browser width and is mobile friendly is kind of a hassle and there are multiple ways to handle it. You would have to think about breakpoints and have separate styles for certain breakpoints. In Semantic UI, many of the elements and collections (containers, grids, images) already have that handled, although not perfect, but still convenient.

### Fast Interactive Prototypes
With Semantic UI, making a responsive wireframe and creating the basic structure of the site is simplified with containers and grids. Instead of using `<ul>` and `<li>`'s in HTML and then adding css to create a menubar, Semantic UI already has premade CSS classes for that which you can just use in a `<div>`.

### Premade Elements
The menus, dropdowns, buttons, labels, inputs, etc. are conveniently premade. Instead of using `<ul>` and `<li>`'s in HTML and then adding css to create a menubar, Semantic UI already has premade CSS classes for that which you can just use in a `<div>`. Also, I appreciate how icons from FontAwesome are included and you can easily resize it with basic words in the CSS class which removes the hassle of embedding an svg or vector in an image tag with specific sizing. For example, to create a facebook icon

## Downfalls of Semantic UI
Something that I find somewhat confusing is trying to find the correct CSS class selector in Semantic UI for certain elements when you want to customize and override the default style. It is not in the documentation what the CSS class selector is, for example, if you wanted to customize and remove the border of the menu. In Photoshop or Illustrator, since it is a visual editor, you would just click on the element and style it accordingly.
