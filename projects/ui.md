## Flowater

I provided consultation for Flowater, an Inc 500 company, and a prototype design of possible features for their upcoming new product development.

## Blurr

Blurr was a group participating in the UH Business Plan Competition. They asked me to create a UI prototype for their app and help bring together their ideas visually.
