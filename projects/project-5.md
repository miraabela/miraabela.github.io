summary: Creativity for expressing ideas and solving problems
---

**Art and photography taught me how to use the tools and resources that I had creatively in order to express my imagination and vision.**  A simple idea in art can be expressed in many ways, similar to how there are multiple solutions and approaches to solving problems.  Creativity is the ability of **making use of the tools and techniques that you know to express an idea**, whether it be with colored pencils or through lines of code.

Utilizing various forms of art media (watercolor, pencils, etc), my digital camera, and Adobe Photoshop, I developed my creativity skill and ability to **pay close attention to details.**
