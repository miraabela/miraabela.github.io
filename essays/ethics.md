##  Origin of Ethics

My personal sense of ethics comes from my religious upbringing. According to my faith, I follow a set of moral codes to live by. As a Christian, one of our core beliefs is to do unto others as you would have them do unto you, which is the Golden Rule. With that, we would only want to do good to other people, if we wanted to be treated equally well. Although the world isn’t fair and sometimes nice people don’t get the justice they deserve at first, I do think everything will eventually come full circle, since God sees everything that we do and knows our intentions. 



## Describe the situation

### Case study: The code I’m still ashamed of

A developer was creating a quiz for a drug company, and the requirements of the quiz were that as long as the person was not allergic to the drug, all answers would lead to recommending the drug as treatment. As a result of him creating the quiz, a young girl had killed herself because of the side effects of the drug. 

”I wish I could tell you that when I first saw those requirements they bothered me. I wish I could tell you that it felt wrong to code something that was basically designed to trick young girls. But the truth is, I didn’t think much of it at the time. I had a job to do, and I did it.”


There are so many problems with this. The first violation (ACM 1.2) is that his actions caused harm (depression- psychological harm) and eventually death to this young girl. The second offense (ACM 1.1) is that the company was not serving the People first, it was serving the Profits of the drug first.  The third offense is that the quiz is a lack of honesty (ACM 1.3) by making misleading claims to trick the innocent girl and not disclosing the side effects. As an extreme example, the last sentence is almost akin to how Nazi’s defense their actions because they were “just following orders.”

## Personal Opinion

I am disgusted with this behavior because I suffered through depression during my early teen years. Back then I was searching for ways to make myself normal again, and that included frequent trips to different types of doctors (alternative and traditional) and being prescribed multiple drugs. I know how it feels to take anti-depressants, those things mess with your brain and actually made my depression worse. I am disheartened deeply to hear that a young innocent girl with so much potential was only looking for relief for her condition but instead was lead astray and eventually to death because of the careless actions of some guy who was just trying to make money.
